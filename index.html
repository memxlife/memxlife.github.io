<h2>Research Vision</h2>

<p>
My long-term vision is to build personalized embodied intelligent systems — small, continuously learning and self-evolving artificial agents that understand and interact with the physical world. By bridging machine learning algorithms with system software and silicon, I seek to develop adaptive cyber-physical intelligence that co-evolves with individuals over time, serving as intelligent companions that augment human capability, support lifelong growth, and deepen personal understanding of the world.
</p>

<h2>Research Directions</h2>

<h3>1. Bridging Machine Learning Algorithms with System Software and Silicon</h3>
<p>
Designing vertically integrated AI systems that co-optimize models, compilers, runtimes, and hardware architectures.
</p>

<h3>2. Efficient Machine Learning Systems</h3>
<p>
Developing scalable training and inference systems that improve computational efficiency, robustness, and energy-performance tradeoffs.
</p>

<h3>3. Physical & Embodied Intelligence</h3>
<p>
Exploring adaptive, physically grounded agents capable of continual learning, perception–action integration, and sustained real-world interaction.
